/*  TODO: 
  [x] arena allocators 
  [x] scope (non existent, we just use global bindings)

  [] the 'ir' we have now is a crappy mix of MIR and HIR. we should have a fully typed, labelled, annotated (with debug info)
     instruction based typed ir, which we can call MIR. this would be basically equivalent to 
     LLVM IR. and then an untyped IR which would be more for interpreter execution, or lower level
     parsing, whatever.

  [] fix double free in Value when we make temps that are copies of structs.
    double free -- we don't really track _WHO_ is the original owned pointer of a struct,
    so when we create tempoaries that are copies of that struct for member access and such,
    all of them get freed, and obviously that is bad.

  [] fix ownership of alloca's: when we return a struct literal it gets destroyed on return.
  
  [] be able to manipulate unmanaged pointers with native code
  [] be able to take non-array managed pointers with native code.

  [] improve ffi for structs, actual argument and return value marshalling
  [] either sized arrays or get rid of arrays
  
  [] string literals of 'string' type (fat pointer), not raw byte*
*/

/*  Features:
  [] add modules and importing
  [] add generics
  [] add contractual types
  
  easier to use and more extensible extern defs:
    [] add 'extern \"symbol_name\" from \"library_path\" our_fn_name :: (...) ...'; syntax
    [] add 'extern \"library name\" { ... group of functions ... }' syntax.
